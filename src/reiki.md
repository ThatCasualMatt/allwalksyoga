Reiki teaches us that we are more than just our physical bodies and that Reiki surrounds us as an energy body. Reiki energy connects on our spiritual and energetic levels. Distant Reiki sessions work because energy is not limited by distance. Distance is only a physical limitation, so sessions can be done without clients being physically present. We are all connected, as we are all energy matter and part of a larger whole.

To receive distant Reiki healing you don’t have to do anything special. The effects of distant healing are virtually no different than hands-on healing. An experienced Reiki healer can send healing energy to a person anywhere in the world no matter how far away from the healer they are. The energy transmissions in a remote session are just as strong as if they were delivered in person directly with the hands. Distant healings are ideal for those who don’t live in a reasonable distance from a practitioner, people who don’t have the means to travel to and from a healers office, or if you don’t particularly like someone touching you, a distance healer can provide the same benefit without the need to physically touch. Those who are interested in receiving a Reiki healing session do not have to be suffering from any type of illness to benefit from a session. Sessions can help keep the energy channels open, decreasing the likelihood of illness due to blocked Chakras.

Try a distant Reiki session for yourself and experience the benefits.
