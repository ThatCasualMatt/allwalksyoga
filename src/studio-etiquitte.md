## STUDIO ETIQUITTE

At All Walks Yoga we want everyone to feel accepted and welcomed in our classes. We've compiled a brief list of tips and expectations to help you make the most out of your time in our classes.

We encourage your to arrive 10 to 15 minutes early to class. This will give you sufficient time to find parking, check in for class, and find your spot on the floor so you can start to relax before we get started.

You will need a mat, towel and water bottle. We also recommend Yoga blocks to help with balance. However, we understand that not everyone may have these items, especially if you are new to Yoga, and we do have a few mats, towels, and block available for rent, but most people prefer to bring their own.

Before entering our classes, we ask that you turn your phones all the way off. We understand that at times there may be situations that may prevent you from doing this. If that's the case, please let us know so that is something comes up we know not to be worried if you have to step out and take a call.

We want to make the most out of your experience with us. If you have any injuries, special health conditions, or other concerns, please talk to the instructor before class so that we can help you find accessible alternatives to poses or routines.

If you find at any point that the class is causing your discomfort, take a break when needed. Lie in a comfortable pose for as long as you need.
