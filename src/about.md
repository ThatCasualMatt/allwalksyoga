> "All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them." -Walt Disney

When I started my yoga teacher training I knew I wanted to bring accessible yoga to those who need it. As someone who is overweight, and has a completely fused spine, I struggled through my yoga journey. "All Levels" classes often weren't and I had to discover variations of poses on my own. This struggle was hard enough to almost make me give up on yoga. But through it all, I persevered and now my dream is becoming a reality.

As a teacher in the Akron Public School system and a member of the Kenmore community, I knew that Kenmore Boulevard was where I wanted to share my vision of Yoga and be apart of the amazing things that are happening in this community. I'm excited to bring All Walks Yoga, an accessible yoga studio, to Kenmore Boulevard and the surrounding community.
